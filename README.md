# Overview-of-Temporal-Causal-Discovery

This repo presents an overview of causal discovery from temporal data, including links to related papers, corresponding codes, and datasets.

Temporal causal discovery aims to learn causal relations from temporal data and is considered an interesting yet fundamental task in finance, medicine, and industry. 
According to whether the data is calibrated, the temporal data for causal discovery can be categorized into two groups, i.e., **multivariate time series (MTS)** and **event sequences**.
